     Programming language is very important because it defines the link, semantics and grammar,
 which allows the programmers to effectively communicate with the machines which they program.
 A programming language serves several purposes:
 1-you'll be able to instruct the pc what to try to in a very human-readable form 
 2-Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc. 
 This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" which might be developed by a group of developers 
 Provides portability - the low-level instructions of one computer are different from that of another computer.
