            <size=16><font color="green" face="arial"> there are four major types of programming paradigms; namely: Imperative,
              
                Functional, Logical and Object-Oriented.
  
              The imperative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; programming paradigm was one of the earliest and was developed
               using machine-language. It is also the basis on which all hardware is impleme
               nted. This was further confirmed by a published journal by Laird(2009) in which h
               e stated that “In imperative programming, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statements are instructions at the native
                machine-level, and they contain states and variables that point right to the memory.”  
                Some of its merits include but not limited to: close to the machine – fast execution ti
                me, more efficient. Whilst, on the other hand, its weaknesses are order sensitive and the 
                limitation of abstraction. Functional programming&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is essentially less complex and offers bette
                r readability than imperative.
              
              This paradigm is thought of to have been originated from a mathematical discipline. Merits include
              : compare to imperative it has a higher level of abstraction, is not tied to dependency. Some of the 
              weakness include: less efficiency, troubleshooting variables or it’s sequential activities are better ha
              ndled in both Object-Oriented or imperatively. Unlike the other major paradigms, the Logical paradigm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is v
              astly different in that it focusses primarily on predicate logic — relation. This is also a vital part of the 
              logic circuit of a computer. Merits of this paradigm include: “problems are solved by the system and Proving t
              he validity of a given program is simple” (the University of Central Florida, n.d). Finally, the Object-Oriented
               paradigm also known as O-O focusses on objects, it’s representation and the behavior they exhibit; rather than var
               iables of the imperative paradigm. O-O borrows from all the major paradigms.</font></size>
