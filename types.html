      There are four major kinds of programming paradigms; namely: Imperative, Functional, Logical and Object-Oriented.

     <b> The imperative programming</b> paradigm was one in all the earliest and was developed using machine-language.
 it's also the concept on which all hardware is implemented. This was further confirmed by a printed journal by Laird (2009) during which he stated that 
 “In imperative programming, statements are instructions at the native machine-level, and that they contain states and variables that time right to the memory.” 
 a number of its merits include but not limited to: near the machine — fast execution time, more efficient. 
 Whilst, on the opposite hand, its weaknesses are order sensitives and also the limitation of abstraction.

      <b> Functional programming</b> is largely less complex and offers better readability than imperative.
 This paradigm is believed of to possess been originated from a mathematical discipline.
 Merits include: compare to imperative it's the next level of abstraction, isn't tied to dependency. 
 A number of the weakness includes: less efficiency, troubleshooting variables or its sequential activities are better handled in both Object-Oriented or imperatively.
 
 Unlike the opposite major paradigms, <b>the Logical paradigm</b> is vastly different therein it focuses totally on predicate logic — relation. this is often also an important a part of the logic circuit of a computer.
 Merits of this paradigm include: “problems are solved by the system, and Proving the validity of a given program is simple” (the University of Central Florida, Nd).

      Finally, <b>the Object-Oriented paradigm </b>is additionally referred to as O-O focuses on objects, it’s representation,and also the behavior they exhibit;
 instead of variables of the imperative paradigm. O-O borrows from all the key paradigms.
